\chapter*{Abstract}

We found that developing a Decentralized Identity Command Line Interface in Rust was possible to do in a way which reused many existing libraries. The libraries we used implemented the core Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)-standards, so we did not have to do it ourselves.

We found that Rust is well supported by the SSI-community. It is a pleasant experience to develop in Rust in a SSI context, because the community is able to help with development, examples, questions along the way.
