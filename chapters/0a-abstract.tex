\chapter*{Abstract}

Exploring our \acrfull{ssi} future, by developing a \acrfull{did-cli} - in the \gls{rust} programming language, using \gls{did-key}, \acrfull{didcomm} and \acrfull{vc}.

Our results show that Rust is well-suited for developing \acrshort{didcomm} applications, due to good community support. Having said that, it is still early days and some key libraries like \gls{did-kit} and \gls{didcomm-rs} needs  maturing before we could wholeheartedly recommend them for production use.
