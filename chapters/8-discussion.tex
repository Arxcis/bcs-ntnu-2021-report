\section{Talking to people about SSI \acrfull{ssi}}

A challenge that has surfaced during development, is how do you explain \acrshort{ssi} to people. A lot of different people have shown interest in this project during development. Here is a list of the different people, that need different explanations, based on their existing knowledge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parents
    \item Siblings
    \item Tech-savy-friends
    \item Non-tech-savy friends
    \item IT Colleagues
    \item University staff
\end{itemize}

Wired Magazine has a series of videos on youtube.com explaining a big concept in 5 levels of difficulty. One of their videos explains gravity in 5 levels\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUey-DVYjk}. This got me thinking: What Would a "5 levels of SSI"-video look like?

A list of concepts to get people "hooked":
\begin{itemize}
    \item Attester
    \item Vitnemål
    \item Kursbevis
    \item Kontrakter
    \item ID
    \item Skjøter
    \item Titler
    \item Fødselsattest
    \item Pass
    \item BankID

    \item Penger (cryptocurrency)
    \item Helsejournal - 200 different countries, 200 different helth care apps?
    \item Resepter
    \item ...and more
\end{itemize}
