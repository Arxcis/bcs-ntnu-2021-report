\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Summary}

The most important results which came out if this project was not the code that was developed, but the learning that took place while developing the code. Developing the code put us on a learning journey much more valuable than the resulting codes intrinsic value. We might as well throw away the code after we are done here. \acrshort{did-cli} is a prototype we do not care much about. What we do care about is what the prototype made us discover.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We learned that a novel DIDComm transport over STDIN/STDOUT is useful and may deserve a specification.
    \item We learned that Rust have up to date implementations of all the core SSI-standards like DIDs, DIDComm and VCs.
    \item We learned that educating people about SSI is challenging and requires a lot of thought to get right.
    \item We learned that the SSI standards community is very fond of newcomers and appreciates a "fresh pair of eyes" on the WIP specifications.
\end{itemize}


\section{Thoughts about DIDComm over STDIN/STDOUT}

DIDComm over \acrshort{stdin}/\acrshort{stdout}.


\section{Rust as an SSI programming language}

We were able to implement all core SSI standards using existing Rust crates. 

@TODO List and discuss the different crates.

\section{Talking to people about SSI}

A challenge that has surfaced during development, is how do you explain \acrshort{ssi} to people. A lot of different people have shown interest in this project during development. Here is a list of the different people, that need different explanations, based on their existing knowledge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parents
    \item Siblings
    \item Tech-savy-friends
    \item Non-tech-savy friends
    \item IT Colleagues
    \item University staff
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
Wired Magazine has a series of videos on youtube.com explaining a big concept in 5 levels of difficulty. One of their videos explains gravity in 5 levels\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUey-DVYjk}. This got me thinking: What Would a "5 levels of SSI"-video look like?

A list of concepts to get people "hooked":
\begin{itemize}
    \item Attester
    \item Vitnemål
    \item Kursbevis
    \item Kontrakter
    \item ID
    \item Skjøter
    \item Titler
    \item Fødselsattest
    \item Pass
    \item BankID
    \item Førerkort
    \item Bankkontoer
    \item Lånebevis
    \item Penger (cryptocurrency)
    \item Helsejournal - 200 different countries, 200 different helth care apps?
    \item Resepter
    \item ...and more
\end{itemize}
