\chapter{Functional Requirements}\label{functional-requirements}}

This chapters systematically lays out the functional requirements which
has to be implemented in the proof-of-concept application to satisfy the
1.7.2 scenario.

\hypertarget{functional-requirements-layers}{%
\section{Functional Requirements
Layers}\label{functional-requirements-layers}}

The become a full SSI agent, our proof-of-concept will have to implement
functionality across 4 distinct layers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Layer 1:} DID
\item
  \textbf{Layer 2:} DIDComm
\item
  \textbf{Layer 3:} Verifiable Credentials
\item
  \textbf{Layer 4:} Application (Scenario)
\end{itemize}

The specific names I have used for the layers are based on my own
interpretation of the SSI stack. You will find that many different names
are used across the literature. Although the names of the layers are not
stable, there is a general agreement about the number of layers and
their scopes. Below is an image depicting an alternate view of the SSI
stack.

\textbf{Sidenote on Sovrin:}

The image above refers the the Sovrin SSI stack. Sovrin is popular
alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum as an SSI ledger. What
differentiates Sovrin from Ethereum and Bitcoin is that it is a ``public
permissioned'' blockchain, whereas Bitcoin and Ethereum is ``public
permissionless''.

\hypertarget{bdd-style-requirements}{%
\section{BDD-style Requirements}\label{bdd-style-requirements}}

The rest of this chapter is heavily influenced by BDD (Behaviour Driven
Development). BDD is concerned how we should specify the behaviour of
the application we are developing. BDD states that we should write our
functional requirements describing behaviour in a human readable format.
In BDD all our requirements should be easily translatable to tests. BDD
is a tool for bridging the gap between technical engineers and
non-technical users of the software.

Here are some of quotes about the philosophy behind BDD:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Test method names should be sentences''
\item
  ````Behaviour'' is a more useful word than ``test''''
\item
  ``Requirements are behaviour, too''
\item
  ``BDD provides a ``ubiquitous language'' for analysis''
\end{itemize}

\emph{See ``Introducing BDD'' by Dan North -

\hypertarget{bdd-ubiquitous-language}{%
\subsection{BDD Ubiquitous Language}\label{bdd-ubiquitous-language}}

BDD ubiquitous language is the language we use when writing BDD-style
requirements.

\hypertarget{story-template}{%
\subsubsection{Story template}\label{story-template}}

A \textbf{story template} describes functionality we want to implement,
and is described like this:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{As a} {[}X{]} \textbf{I want} {[}Y{]} \textbf{so that} {[}Z{]}
\end{quote}

where Y is some feature, Z is the benefit or value of the feature, and X
is the person (or role) who will benefit. \textgreater{}

Example of valid \textbf{story-template:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
**Title: Customer withdraws cash**

**As a** customer,
**I want** to withdraw cash from an ATM,
**so that** I don't have to wait in line at the bank.
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{scenario-template}{%
\subsubsection{Scenario template}\label{scenario-template}}

The BDD ubiquitous language also provides a template for describing
different \textbf{scenarios} connected to the \textbf{story-template:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
**Given** some initial context (the givens),  
**When** an event occurs,  
**Then** ensure some outcomes.
\end{lstlisting}

Here is an example of a valid \textbf{scenario:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
**Scenario: Account is in credit**

**Given** the account is in credit
**And** the card is valid
**And** the dispenser contains cash
**When** the customer requests cash
**Then** ensure the account is debited
**And** ensure cash is dispensed
**And** ensure the card is returned
\end{lstlisting}

There could be multiple \textbf{scenarios} per feature:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
**Scenario: Account is overdrawn past the overdraft limit

Given** the account is overdrawn
**And** the card is valid
**When** the customer requests cash
**Then** ensure a rejection message is displayed
**And** ensure cash is not dispensed
**And** ensure the card is returned
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{layer-1---did}{%
\section{Layer 1 - DID}\label{layer-1---did}}

Layer 1 is concerned with the creation of Self-sovereign agents, which
can be uniquely identified by a DID. As you will notice, each
sub-chapter from now on, will have a list of requirements written out as
user-stories.

\hypertarget{as-a-user-i-want-to-create-a-agent-inside-a-directory-on-my-machine}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{As a user I want to create a
agent inside a directory on my
machine}}{As a user I want to create a agent inside a directory on my machine}}\label{as-a-user-i-want-to-create-a-agent-inside-a-directory-on-my-machine}}

\begin{lstlisting}
**GIVEN** I am in an empty directory
**WHEN** I run *did init* (like *git init*)
**THEN** an agent should be created and stored in the sub-directory *.did/ (*like *.git/*)
    and ****all sub-sequent commands, when run from this directory, implicitly refers 
            to the agent stored in *.did*/ (like how all *git* commands implicitly refers
            to the git history stored in .git/).
\end{lstlisting}

Note: A directory initialised by \emph{did init} will from now on be
referred to as an agent-directory.

\hypertarget{as-a-user-i-want-to-view-an-agents-did}{%

**GIVEN** I am in an agent-directory
    and I have a DID *did:key:z6Mkjid...*
**WHEN** I run *did connect doctor did:key:z6Mkjid...*
**THEN** the name *doctor* should be stored in my agent
    and I should be able to use *doctor* in other commands, instead of typing the 
        whole underlying DID.
    and the name *doctor* should be written to *stdout*, to enable chaining together 
        commands.
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{as-a-user-i-want-to-refer-to-my-agents-did-by-using-the-name-self}{%

    and I there are some *names* stored in the agent
**WHEN** I run *did dids*

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{As a user I want to view the DID connected to a

\begin{lstlisting}
**GIVEN** I am in an agent-directory
    and the agent has a name *police*

**THEN** the DID of *police* should be written to *stdout*.
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{layer-2---didcomm}{%
\section{Layer 2 - DIDComm}\label{layer-2---didcomm}}

Layer 2 is concerned with \textbf{encrypting}, \textbf{sending},
\textbf{receiving} and \textbf{decrypting} DIDComm-messages between the
self-sovereign agents from Layer 1.

\hypertarget{as-a-user-i-want-to-write-a-dcem-from-one-agent-to-another}{%
\subsubsection{As a user I want to write a DCEM from one agent to
another}\label{as-a-user-i-want-to-write-a-dcem-from-one-agent-to-another}}

\begin{lstlisting}
**GIVEN** I have two agents on my machine
    **and** I am in one of the agent-directories
    **and** I have stored the DID of the other agent by the name *other*
**WHEN** I run *did write other hello*, with the contents "Hello"
**THEN** a DCEM should be written to *stdout*
    **and** the DCEM should be addressed to *other*.
\end{lstlisting}

**THEN** the DCEM should be stored inside my agent with the id of the DCEM
    **and** the DCEM should be written to *stdout*.
\end{lstlisting}

If an existing DCEM has id=4, and a new DCEM also has id=4, then new
DCEM should overwrite the one already held by the agent (a message
received should be store idempotent).
