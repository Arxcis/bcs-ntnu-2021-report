\chapter{Conclusion}


\section{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learned a lot of the theory behind SSI.
    \item Learned a lot about writing an academic report.
    \item Learned a new programming language.
    \item Demonstrated practical application of a SSI-agent with a CLI.
\end{itemize}



\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Make CLI-agent interoperable with other DIDComm implementations}

\subsection{Support multiple DID-methods}

\subsection{Support multiple DIDComm transports}

\subsection{Investigate selective disclosure of verifiable credentials}

\subsubsection{BBS-Signatures}

\subsection{Automated testing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The DID CLI implementation is currently lacking an automated testing suite.
    \item Manual testing is tedious, error-prone, time-consuming.
    \item A proper framework for testing, should have been part of the application architecture.
\end{itemize}
