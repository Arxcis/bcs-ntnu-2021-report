\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Support other \gls{did-method} than \gls{did-key}}

If we found a way to integrate the universal resolver\footnote{https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver} into \gls{did-cli}, we would get a huge increase in the amount of \glspl{did-method} we could resolve.

Supporting a \gls{did-method} fully requires more than just the resolving \acrshort{dids} though. Creating and updating \acrshort{dids} requires a lot more engineering though and is not something you just get for free by intergrating the Universal Resolver.

\subsection{Automated testing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The DID CLI implementation is currently lacking an automated testing suite.
    \item Manual testing is tedious, error-prone, time-consuming.
    \item A proper framework for testing, should have been part of the application architecture.
\end{itemize}
