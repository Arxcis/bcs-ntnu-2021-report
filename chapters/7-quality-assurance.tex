\section{Manual testing}

When developing, most testing happens by manually running commands in the terminal, making sure they work correctly.
 
\section{Scenario Demonstration}

Demonstrating that DID CLI is able to solve the scenario put forth by the stakeholders, gives the team valuable feedback. The stakeholders will verify if the problem has been solved, and raise potential issues. This demonstration is an iterative process, and the stakeholders will receive the demonstration multiple times during development, to get as many iteration cycles as possible.
