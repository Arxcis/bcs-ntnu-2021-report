\chapter{Functional Requirements}

This chapter contains a detailed analysis of the functional requirements of \acrshort{did-cli}.

\section{A fantasy scenario}

\paragraph{}
To motivate the development of \acrshort{did-cli}'s requirements we want to define a real-world scenario which \acrshort{did-cli} should be the solution to. The real-world scenario depicted below is just for demonstration purposes and not an actual scenario:

\paragraph{}
\textit{The norwegian drivers license issuer, Statens Vegvesen, is considering to start issuing it's drivers licenses as \acrfull{vc}s. Statens Vegvesen is not sure if \acrshort{vc}s are the future yet, but are willing to try and dip it's toes into the water.}

\paragraph{}
\textit{What Statens Veivesen want is a proof-of-concept to be developed, which will issue, hold and verify driver-licenses as \acrfull{vc}s. The proof-of-concept should demonstrate how it handles a situation were a driver is pulled over by the police.}

\section{Functional Requirements Writing Style}

The functional requirement are written with User-Stories templates as titles and with \acrfull{bdd} templates as descriptions.


\section{Functional Requirement Layers}

The functional requirements are grouped together in 4 groups. Each group represents a layer in the \acrshort{ssi}-stack.
\begin{description}
    \item[Layer 1:] \acrfull{did}
    \item[Layer 2:] \acrfull{didcomm}
    \item[Layer 3:] \acrfull{vc}
    \item[Layer 4:] Application (User story)
\end{description}

\section{Functional Requirements Layer 1 - DID}


\subsection{As a user I want to create a agent inside a directory on my machine}
\begin{description}
    \item[Given] I am in an empty directory
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did init}
    \item[Then] an agent should be created in the directory
    \item[and] all the agent's files should be stored in the sub-directory .did/, like .git/
    \item[and] the agent's DID should be written to stdout 
    \item[and] a the DIDName \texttt{self} should be linked to the DID
    \item[and] the directory is now of the type "agent-directory".
\end{description}


\subsection{As a user I want to view an agent's DID}
\begin{description}
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did init}
    \item[or] I run \texttt{did did self}
    \item[Then] the agent's DID should be written to \texttt{stdout}.
\end{description}


\subsection{As a user I want to view an agent's DID document}
\begin{description}
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did doc}
    \item[Then] the agent's DID-document should be written to \texttt{stdout} as prettified JSON.
\end{description}


\subsection{As a user I want to connect a name to a DID}
\begin{description}
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[and] I have a DID \texttt{did:key:z6MkjidGmTqu3jG73hVdz5MKEGtVLCLof9ctxTXHMomNcivxA}
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did connect doctor did:key:z6MkjidGmTqu3jG73hVdz5MKEGtVLCLof9ctxTXHMomNcivx}
    \item[Then] the name \texttt{doctor} should be stored in the agent
    \item[and] I should be able to use \texttt{doctor} in other commands, instead of typing the whole underlying DID.
    \item[and] the name \texttt{doctor} should be written to \texttt{stdout}, to enable chaining together commands.
\end{description}


\subsection{As a user I want to refer to an agent's DID by using the name self}
\begin{description}
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[When] I run any command. Example: \texttt{did write self hello}
    \item[Then] I should be able to refer to the agents own DID by the name \texttt{self}.
\end{description}


\subsection{As a user I want to view all my DID's}
\begin{description}
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[and] I there are some DIDNames stored in the agent
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did dids}
    \item[Then] a list of all the agent's DIDNames should be written to `stdout`.
\end{description}


\subsection{As a user I want to view a DIDName's DID}
\begin{description}
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[and] the agent has a DIDName \texttt{police}
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did did police}
    \item[Then] the DID of \texttt{police} should be written to \texttt{stdout}.
\end{description}

\section{Functional Requirements Layer 2 - DIDComm}

\subsection{As a user I want to write a DCEM from one agent to another}

\begin{description}[1.35cm]
    \item[Given] I have two agents on my machine
    \item[and] I am in one of the agent-directories
    \item[and] I have stored the DID of the other agent by the name \texttt{other}
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did write other hello}, with the contents "Hello".
    \item[Then] a DCEM should be written to \texttt{stdout}
    \item[and] the DCEM should be addressed to \texttt{other}. 
\end{description}

For more info on DCEM - DIDComm Encrypted Message - see: https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/\#didcomm-encrypted-message.



\subsection{As a user I want to read the contents of a DCEM addressed to an agent}
\begin{description}[1.35cm]
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[and] I receive a DCEM-file - \texttt{hello.dcem} - addressed to my agent
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did read \$(cat hello.dcem)} 
    \item[or] I run \texttt{cat hello.dcem | did read}
    \item[Then] the plaintext contents of the DCEM should be written to \texttt{stdout}.
\end{description}



\subsection{As a user I want to hold a DCEM inside an agent}
\begin{description}[1.35cm]
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[and] I receive a DCEM-file - \texttt{hello.dcem} - addressed to my agent
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did hold \$(cat hello.dcem)} 
    \item[or] I run \texttt{cat hello.dcem | did hold}
    \item[Then] the DCEM should be stored inside my agent with the id of the DCEM
    \item[and] the DCEM should be written to `stdout`.
\end{description}

Note: If an existing DCEM has id=4, and a new DCEM also has id=4, then new DCEM should overwrite the one already held by the agent.



\subsection{As a user I want to view a list of all DCEMs an agent is holding}
\begin{description}[1.35cm]
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[and] the agent is holding multiple DCEMs
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did messages}

    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory
    \item[and] there is a DCEM with id \texttt{7497036273686508746}, held by the agent
    \item[When] I run \texttt{did message 7497036273686508746}
    \item[Then] the DCEM should be written to \texttt{stdout}.
\end{description}

    \item[When] I run \texttt{did issue Passport bob}
    \item[Then] a DCEM with a Verifiable Credential of type \texttt{Passport}, with \texttt{vc.subject.did} of \texttt{bob}, and with \texttt{vc.issuer.did} of \texttt{self}, should be written to \texttt{stdout}.
\end{description}



\subsection{As a holder I want to present a Verifiable presentation to a verifier}
\begin{description}[1.35cm]
    \item[Given] I am in an agent-directory

    \item[and] it succeeds
    \item[And] I can trust that the\texttt{vp.type} is \texttt{Passport}
    \item[Then] I can trust that the \texttt{vp.vc.issuer.did} is \texttt{police}
    \item[And] I can trust that the \texttt{vp.vc.subject.did} is \texttt{jonny}
